## 🚀 One-Sentence Pitch
AuraVisor is an AI-enabled wearable that empowers blind individuals by detecting people, objects, text, and currency, providing real-time spoken feedback to enhance navigation, independence, and safety.

---

## 🧭 Problem
- Over 3.5 million visually impaired people in Egypt lack affordable, intelligent assistive solutions.
- Traditional tools like white canes and basic ultrasonic sticks offer only obstacle detection.
- Current AI-based products like OrCam cost over $3000 and lack integrated features like GPS or people recognition.

## ✨ Solution
AuraVisor is a low-cost, portable smart glasses solution that:
1. Recognizes faces, objects, text (OCR), and money.
2. Delivers real-time audio descriptions via speaker.
3. Responds to user voice commands.
4. Offers live GPS location tracking for caregivers.
